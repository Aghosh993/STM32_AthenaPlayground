# STM32 F4 Discovery Ethernet Demo

The application in this directory implements a very barebones Ethernet LwIP (Lightweight IP) interface. The PHY used is a [DP83848](http://www.waveshare.com/dp83848-ethernet-board.htm) from Waveshare, via RMII. A static IP is set up through the LwIP API, and TCP connections processed in a polling fashion (TODO: need to investigate DMA and IRQ-driven I/O to increase throughput and efficiency). The connections made between the breakout and the STM32 F4 Discovery board can be found [here](http://blog.tkjelectronics.dk/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Ethernet-connections.png). Once the firmware is loaded and reset, the board should set its own IP to 192.168.0.9 with a /24 subnet. The user needs to configure a static IP for their own machine on the same subnet, at which point one should be able to ping the board.
